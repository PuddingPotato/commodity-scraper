This COOP internship project aims to collect macroeconomic and commodity-related data from various web sources using Python-based web scraping. The collected data serves multiple purposes:

- To perform market research and track economic trends

- To integrate with technical indicators and signals

- To visualize key metrics using Tableau dashboards

- To support data-driven analysis and trading strategies

The ultimate goal is to build a comprehensive data pipeline that supports market analysis, backtesting, and decision-making based on real-world financial data.
